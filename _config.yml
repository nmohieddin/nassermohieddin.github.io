body: “A Course in Machine Learning” is a great book that introduces the main aspects of Machine Learning. The book discusses different decision making models and touches on real lids examples. I am interested in this book because I want to learn more about machine learning and its application in artificial intelligence, which became a game changer in the modern world and will continue to take a bigger role in our daily lives.
